# An Easy Take-out Implementation

This is a simple implementation of a take-out system.
It is a simple system that allows the user to order food from a restaurant and allows
the restaurant employees to manage the orders and the stock information.

This project follows a tutorial video from [BiliBili 黑马](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV13a411q753/) with minor
modifications to adapt some up-to-date technologies. Thus, the main system design is not original, but this is not
a simple copy-paste project. The project focuses on the implementation of the backend. Although the frontend is given
directly from the tutorial,
it is always a good practice to know some basic frontend technologies.
